REL is a project initiated by Jules Peck, with support from Fondation Charles Leopold Mayer, New Economics Foundation, Transition Network, and Metamaps.cc - read more at flourishingenterprise.org\\nThe aim of the lab is to build a participatory platform which provides a unifying picture of the projects, ideas, movements and networks offering viable alternatives to the faltering status quo, and to present this as a compelling case for wider strategic collaboration, coordination and support by all stakeholders. We invite you to take part.\\n\\nAn increasing array of practitioners and thinkers are working towards a new economic system. How can the groups and organisations carrying out these efforts be mapped? What are their connections? The first step involves turning to prominent groups in the field and asking: what matters to your work, what are your ambitions, and how are you trying to achieve your aims?\\n\\nThe following 20 questions invite you to plot the work of your organisation or group against a series of lenses.The responses and indeed the lenses are not set in stone, but will provide a basis to start building towards a better understanding of how the different players in the broad field relate and interact.\\n\\nData will be used in it's early stages to create infographic and graph-based visualisations by the REL team.

Diese Treffen sind nicht-kommerzielle Veranstaltungen, deren Ziel es ist, Müll zu vermeiden, Ressourcen zu sparen, damit die Umwelt zu schonen und nachhaltige Lebensweisen in der Praxis zu erproben.\\nAußerdem unterlaufen die Initiativen durch die Reparaturen geplante Obsoleszenz und verlängern die Nutzungsdauer von Gebrauchsgütern. Interessierte und TüftlerInnen können dort Erfahrungen austauschen und eine gute Zeit miteinander verbringen. Daher sind Kaffee und Kuchen ebenso wichtiger Bestandteil wie Schraubenzieher und Lötkolben.\" (Quelle http://reparatur-initiativen.de/seite/ueber-uns/)","project state":"Working","organisation":"Stiftungsgemeinschaft Anstiftung & Ertomis","name":"Reparatur-Initiativen","origin country":"Germany","uuid":"","url":"http://reparatur-initiativen.de/","topic":"","state":"","data sourcing":"","tools":"OpenStreetMap,","language":"","comment":"Created page with \"{{Datasource ","further Information":"","type":"Mapping System","relation with mmm14":"In contact through Tom Hansing","remarks":"","languages":"German,","standards":"","data license":"","communities":"","poi type":"","license url":"","contact email":"","license":"","platform license":""}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-39.848562190636244,35.09695673980704]},"properties":{"contact url":"http://www.repowermap.org/about.php?ln=en","concept":"repowermap.org is a non-profit initiative to promote renewable energies and energy efficiency by making visible real-world examples and related local information in each person's neighbourhood.","topics":"","coverage":"global","description":"","project state":"Working","organisation":"","name":"Repower map","origin country":"","uuid":"763e11bf-c5ef-46fa-9352-0707e1d107af","url":"http://www.repowermap.org/index.php?ln=en","topic":"Map of renewable energy and energy efficiency projects/installations/events in your neighbourhood","state":"","data sourcing":"crowd based","tools":"Google Maps","language":"Multiple","comment":"","further Information":"there are over 40 000 entries.
